## <p align="center">![alt text](https://github.com/Y4SS11N3/AirBnB_clone/blob/master/web_static/images/logo_1.png?raw=true)</p>

## Introduction
In this part of the AirBnB clone project, we focus on the front-end, specifically on creating static web pages. This phase involves crafting the HTML and CSS that define the structure and style of the pages, mimicking the layout and design of a typical AirBnB page. From simple page layouts with headers and footers to more complex arrangements involving filters, dropdowns, and responsive designs, each task builds upon the previous to incrementally develop a comprehensive web static component for the clone.

## Project Structure
